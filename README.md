# Awakado
Awakado is a smart alarm clock that wakes you up based on your sleep cycle and show you a to-do list.

The average human takes 14 minutes to fall asleep. Once asleep, they enter 90 minute sleep cycles. Waking up at the end of one of these cycles results in feeling the most well-rested. 

Our alarm clock aims to awake the user at the end of one of their cycles. It will aim to give them a good nightâ€™s sleep of 5-6 cycles, but it wakes them up sooner if an item on their todo list is earlier. When they turn off the alarm, their todo list for the day is displayed.

The main goal of our project was to create an alarm clock that knows when to wake you up based on your sleep cycles. 
It also displays a to-do list of the events for the day.
